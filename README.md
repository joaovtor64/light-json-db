# simple-database
Simple node-js database for simple needs
***

## THIS IS CURRENTLY **UNSAFE**: FILES ARE SAVED AS SHA256 AND THEIR NAMES CAN BE LOST - SAVE THEIR NAMES IN THEM TO COUNTER-ACT THIS ISSUE
Loads of simple things are not implemented yet, please don't use it


 * Todo: 
 - [ ] directories are not listed in `keys()`
 - [ ] Save file-names in them automatically - every file will become a json file
 - [ ] Make directory function
 - [ ] `remove()` should remove directories too
 - [ ] `get()` in directories should `keys()` it
