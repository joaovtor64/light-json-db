Simple node-js database for simple needs

## THIS IS CURRENTLY **UNSAFE**: FILES ARE SAVED AS SHA256 AND THEIR NAMES CAN BE LOST - SAVE THEIR NAMES IN THEM TO COUNTER-ACT THIS ISSUE
Lots of standart features (shown below) are not implemented yet - use with caution


 * Todo: 
 - [ ] directories are not listed in `keys()`: THIS IS DANGEROUS, THEIR NAMES ARE SHAS AND CAN'T BE WORKED BACK
 - [ ] Save file-names in the files themselves automatically - every file will become a json file
 - [ ] Make directory function 
 - [ ] `remove()` should remove directories too
 - [ ] `get()` in directories should `keys()` it
