Simple node-js database for simple needs

 * Todo: 
 - [ ] A file with an array of strings and a directory are indistinguishable from a code perspective (they both will return the same if you `get()` them)
 - [x] directories are not listed in `keys()` (they are now)
 - [x] Save file-names in the files themselves automatically - every file will become a json file
 - [x] Make directory function 
 - [x] `remove()` should remove directories too
 - [x] `get()` in directories should `keys()` it
 - [ ] function for getting file info if `STORE_FILENAME_IN_FILE` is true
